Student Grades Management System (Further Expansion)
    Description: Expand your previous project where you managed student grades.
    Base code: ../fundamentals/7_array_vectors_student_grades_system.cpp
    Requirements:
        Use pointers for dynamic memory allocation of students and subjects.
        Allow functions to add, update, calculate averages, and find highest/lowest grades by reference or pointer.
        Allow to add, delete students and subjects.
    Future Expansion:
        Use a Student class with std::vector fields for subjects and grades.: done
        Use a GradeSystem class to manage all students, subjects and grades.: done
        Implement functions for grade statistics like calculating GPA and displaying grade distribution.
        Add input/output of grades as a txt or csv file: done
        File division: done
        student_grades_system.cpp will be replaced by main.cpp, GradeSystems.cpp and Student.cpp.


How to compile 
    1: using GradeSytems.cpp, Student.cpp, unitlities.cpp and main.cpp
        g++ "./projects/student_grades_system/main.cpp" "./projects/student_grades_system/GradeSystem.cpp" "./projects/student_grades_system/Student.cpp" "./projects/student_grades_system/utilities.cpp" -o "./projects/student_grades_system/program"

    2: using student_grades_system.cpp and unitlities.cpp
        g++ "./projects/student_grades_system/student_grades_system.cpp" "./projects/student_grades_system/utilities.cpp" -o "./projects/student_grades_system/program"
