Things that I have learned through this project

Range-Based for loop
    It constructs a for loop which must execute through a range defined as anything that you can iterate through,
    for example, std::vector, or any other C++ Standard Library sequence whose range is defined by a begin() and end().
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/range-based-for-statement-cpp?view=msvc-170

    Since C++ 11
    It executes a for loop over a range
    https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for

    for(range_declaration : range_expression ){
        Loop Statement
    }

    Ex:
        // the initializer may be a braced-init-list
        for (int n : { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 })
            cout << n << ' ';
        cout << '\n';
        -> 0 1 2 3 4 5
        // Iterating over array
        int a[] = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        for (int n : a)
            cout << n << ' ';
        cout << '\n';
        -> 0 1 2 3 4 5

    Another Ex:
        for(const Student &student : students){
            studentRanks.emplace_back(student.getName(), student.calculateAverage());
        }
        const: 
            use if you don't intend to change the Student objects while Iterating
        &(Reference)
            use if you want to avoid copying each Student object. 
            without &, each iteration would involve creating a copy of the Student object, which is unnecessary overhead in this case.

std::pair
    It is a class template that provides a way to store two heterogeneous objects as a single unit.
    A pair is a specific case of a std::tuple with two elements.
    https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/pair

    It is used to combine together two values that may be of different data types.
    It is used if we want to store tuples.
    The first element is referenced as 'first', and the second element as 'second' and the order is fixed. (first, second)
    We use variable name followed by dot operator with the keyword such as 'first' or 'second'.
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pair-in-cpp-stl/

    std::pair<datatype, datatype> variable name;
    access to elements of pair
        var.first, var.second

std::map
    Is is a class template provided by Standard Library, and is a sorted associative container that includes key-value pairs with unique keys.
    To use it, define #include <map>
    https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map

    std::map<datatype, datatype> variable name;
